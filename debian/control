Description: PAM Module for authenticating with ssh-agent
 Shared library that gets installed where libpam looks for
 modules. When referenced in a pam configuration, the module
 implements authentication success or failure based on whether
 the ssh-agent referenced by the SSH_AUTH_SOCK environment
 variable can correctly sign a random challenge with the private
 key corresponding to any of the public keys referenced in 
 the module configuration args.
