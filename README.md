# A PAM module for authenticating using ssh-agent

The goal of this project is to provide a PAM authentication module determining the identity
of user based on a signature request and response sent via the ssh-agent protocol to a potentially
remote `ssh-agent`.

One scenario that this module can be used in is to grant escalated privileges on a remote
system with the `sudo` command where the identity of the user is confirmed by their ability
to provide a signature made with a local ssh-agent and a private key that never leaves the
designated hardware.

This project is re-implementation of the [pam_ssh_agent_auth](https://github.com/jbeverly/pam_ssh_agent_auth) 
module but does not share any code with that project. The eventual goal of this module is to be 
functionally equivalent and a drop-in replacement instead of pam_ssh_agent_auth.

## Project goals

Since this is security sensitive software and a bug could easily result in undue privilege
escalation, the main goal of this project is to be robust and easy to follow for would-be
reviewers.

The implementation leans heavily on modules available in the Rust ecosystem that implements
the different parts needed for the overall functionality, most notably the pam, ssh-key, 
and ssh-agent-client-rs crates. Using upstream libraries directly is intended to make it
easier to ensure that implementation issues with security implication gets addressed in a
timely manner. A secondary benefit is that supporting a wide range of algorithms is easier.
